\begin{rSection}{Our Mission}
\raggedright
UIUC's Women in Nuclear (WiN) chapter is part of the 
U.S. WiN's ecosystem. U.S. WiN's objectives are to 
drive a culture in nuclear energy and technology 
in which women and men succeed, create professional development 
and networking opportunities for career advancement, and enhance understanding 
and awareness of the value of nuclear energy and technology.

UIUC's WiN chapter uplifts these objectives through 
providing students with a platform to participate 
in activities and grow with respect to our three WiN 
pillars: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Community: To build a strong community within our chapter and 
	with the Nuclear Engineering department at UIUC. 
	\item Outreach: To promote the benefits of nuclear technology to the surrounding 
	Urbana-Champaign community. 
	\item Professional Development: To give our members support and opportunities to excel 
	academically, meet professionals from industry and academia, and go beyond the classroom 
	to visit nuclear-related companies/laboratories. 
\end{enumerate}
